'''Check for Anagram
You are given two String S1 and S2. Determine if the two strings are anagrams of each other.
Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word "listen" is an anagram of "silent".
Note: You will have to ignore case and white spaces.
Sample Input 1: 
Silent
Listen
Sample Output 1: 
Yes
Explanation 1: Silent and Listen has the same letters. If we ignore case, they are anagrams.
Sample Input 2: 
New York Times
monkeys write
Sample Output 2: 
Yes
Explanation 2: If we don't consider white space and case-sensitive, "New York Times" and "monkeys write" are anagrams. They have same characters repeating same number of times.'''


'''Remove Duplicate Characters
You are given a string. Create a new string that contains each character of the original string only once, preserving the order of their first occurrences.
Sample Input: 
programming
Sample Output: 
progamin
